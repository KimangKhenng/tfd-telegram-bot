# What is CTX?
CTX (context) is an object that contains information about the current state of the bot and the incoming update. It is used to pass data between middleware, handlers, and other parts of the bot. The CTX object typically includes details such as the message, user, chat, and other relevant information that allows the bot to respond appropriately to user interactions.
